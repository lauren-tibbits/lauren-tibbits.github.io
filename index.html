                <h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
                <p> My name is Lauren Tibbits. I am 18 years old and a freshman at the University of South Carolina. I am from Cincinnati, Ohio. I have two brothers and a sister as well as two dogs. I am very close with my family and consider them to be some of the most important people in my life. Moving far from home was a difficult decision for me to make, but one that I am very proud I was able to do and have been thankful for this decision every day.</p>
                <p id="aboutme-2" class="hidden"> I am someone who loves to take risks and push boundaries. I set high goals for myself and hold myself to them. Aside from my drive to reach my professional goals, I also love to spend time in the gym. This is something that I find to be stress relieving. I also enjoy spending time with my friends and find comfort with the people I love. I am someone who looks to find the best in every situation and appreciate the place that I am at in life. With that, I am excited to see what my future holds here in South Carolina.</p>

                <h2 id="description">Career Goals</h2>
                <p> In the future, I plan to become a physician. I am currently a double major in biochemistry and spanish. After that, I hope to attend medical school at the Ohio State University. I would love to complete my residency in anesthesia, and further specialize in pediatrics. Anesthesia is especially interesting to me because this is a specialty that I would get to be a part of all different types of procedures.</p>
                <p id="description2" class="hidden"> I want to become a physician because I have always been interested in medicine. My dad has always been an inspiration to me since I've grown up seeing how happy he is in his career. I know that being a physician is something that I would enjoy every day and would feel truly proud of the work that I do. I want to bring people a sense of comfort and safety in the hospital, especially since this is a place that most people don't associate with those feelings.</p>
